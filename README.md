## Authentication

### User Authentication
- **Overview of Django’s default User model**: Understand the fields such as username, password, email, etc.
- **Using `django.contrib.auth`**: Handle user authentication seamlessly.
- **Methods**: Learn how to use the `authenticate()` and `login()` methods effectively.

### Custom User Model
- **Importance**: Understand why creating a custom user model is beneficial(AbstractUser vs. AbstractBaseUser).
- **Steps**: Create and configure a custom user model.
- **Migrating**: Steps to migrate to a custom user model in an existing project.

### Authentication Backends
- **Default Backends**: Explore Django's default authentication backends.
- **Custom Backends**: Learn how to create and configure custom authentication backends.
- **Use Cases**: Implement custom backends for scenarios like integrating LDAP, OAuth.

## Authorization

### Permissions
- **Built-in System**: Utilize Django's built-in permission system.
- **Default Permissions**: Understand default permissions (add, change, delete, view) and their usage.

### Permission Classes
- **Built-in Classes**: Use classes like `IsAuthenticated`, `IsAdminUser`, `AllowAny`.
- **Custom Classes**: Create custom permission classes for specific needs.

### Object-level Permissions
- **Concept**: Grasp the idea of object-level permissions.
- **Libraries**: Use libraries like `django-guardian` for object-level permissions.
- **Custom Implementation**: Implement custom object-level permissions.

### Custom Authorization Logic
- **Decorators**: Use decorators like `@login_required`, `@permission_required`.
- **Mixins**: Implement mixins such as `LoginRequiredMixin`, `PermissionRequiredMixin`.
- **Custom Logic**: Write custom decorators and mixins for complex authorization logic.

## Authentication and Authorization Middleware

### Middleware
- **Role**: Understand the role of middleware in Django’s request/response cycle.
- **Common Middleware**: Learn about common authentication/authorization middleware.

### Session Authentication
- **Working**: How session-based authentication works.
- **Configuration**: Configure session settings, such as session expiry.

### Token-based Authentication
- **Overview**: Understand token-based authentication.
- **Django REST Framework**: Use Token Authentication in Django REST Framework.
- **JWT Authentication**: Implement JWT authentication with libraries like `djangorestframework-jwt` or `simplejwt`.

## Third-party Authentication

### Social Authentication
- **Integration**: Integrate social login providers (Google, Facebook, GitHub) using `django-allauth`.
- **Setup**: Configuration and setup for social authentication.

### OAuth2
- **Protocol**: Explanation of the OAuth2 protocol.
- **Django Integration**: Use Django with OAuth2 as a provider or consumer (e.g., `django-oauth-toolkit`).

## Security Best Practices

### Password Management
- **Hashing Algorithms**: Learn about Django’s password hashing algorithms.
- **Best Practices**: Secure password storage and handling password resets.

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection
- **CSRF Protection**: How Django’s CSRF protection works.
- **Best Practices**: Avoid CSRF attacks effectively.

### Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
- **Importance**: Understand the importance of CORS.
- **Configuration**: Use packages like `django-cors-headers` to enable and configure CORS.

### Rate Limiting
- **Implementation**: Implement rate limiting to protect against brute force attacks using tools like `django-ratelimit`.

## Testing Authentication and Authorization

### Unit Testing
- **Writing Tests**: Write unit tests for authentication logic.
- **Django Test Framework**: Use Django’s test framework for authentication tests.

### Integration Testing
- **Writing Tests**: Write integration tests for authentication and authorization.
- **End-to-End**: Ensure end-to-end functionality.

### Mocking Authentication
- **Mock Objects**: Use mock objects to simulate user authentication in tests.
- **Fixtures**: Use fixtures and factory methods to create test users and permissions.
